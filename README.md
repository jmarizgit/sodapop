Sodapop is PHP with an easy to use and understand syntax. All the power of PHP with a more clean syntax and template system.


## How to use
Write your code without any php declaration, example:

        @name "mariz"
is equal to:
       
       <?php 
            $name = "mariz";
       ?>

##Variables
"@" identifies a variable name and the value following this name is assigned to the variable.
Declare variables is as easy as:
     
         @name "mariz"
